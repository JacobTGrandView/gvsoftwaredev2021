                <h4>Imagine repeating the past month of software development for 8 hrs/day and 5 days/wk and 50 weeks/year for the next year. Wait 30 seconds on the clock, and write out what feelings come up. Write as much as you want.</h4>

                <p>My thoughts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Being challenged and also learning new skills all the time</li>
                    <li>Working with many different people and various skill levels and improving teamwork</li>
                    <li>Things can often be too challenging and have no time for other things</li>
                    <li>Many technical difficulties to get past</li>
                    <li>Takes a lot more effort and time than many more areas of work</li>
                    <li>Repetitive, tiring to sit there for hours and think through tasks</li>
                    <li>I think that if I were to only be doing this and not managing other classes and a sport and family/friend things, then it could be enjoyable and fun to learn along the way. As of right now, I just have a lot going on and I think it can be stressful</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Thinking about what has worked well in previous more time consuming classes and what hasn't</li>
                    <li>Thoughts about what we have done so far in this class</li>
                    <li>Writing everything up</li>
                </ul>
